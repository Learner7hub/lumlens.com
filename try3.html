      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="border-bottom: 2px black solid;">Softbox</span></h1>
      <pre style="text-align: center;">
        A softbox is a type of photographic lighting device, often used in studio or outdoor photography, to create a soft, natural-looking light.
        It consists of a reflective interior and a light diffusing material at the front, which scatters the light and reduces harsh shadows.
        The design of a softbox is such that it encloses a light source, such as a flash tube or bulb, directing the light towards the subject while
        controlling its spread. The size and shape of the softbox can greatly affect the quality and direction of light, with larger softboxes producing
        softer light and smaller ones resulting in a harder light. Softboxes can be square, rectangular, or octagonal in shape, each providing a different 
        quality of light and shadow effect. They are versatile tools that can be used for various types of photography, from portraits to product shots, 
        and are a staple in many professional photographerâ€™s gear. The use of a softbox can significantly improve the quality of lighting in photographs, 
        making them an essential tool for both amateur and professional photographers.

        A tripod is a portable three-legged frame or stand, used as a platform for supporting the weight and maintaining the stability of some 
        other object. Itâ€™s typically used in photography and videography to stabilize and elevate a camera, a flash unit, or other photographic 
        equipment. All tripods have three legs and a mounting head to couple with a camera. The mounting head usually includes a thumbscrew that 
        mates to a female-threaded receptacle on the camera, as well as a mechanism to be able to rotate and tilt the camera when it is mounted 
        on the tripod. Tripod legs are usually made to telescope, in order to save space when not in use. Tripods are usually made from aluminum, 
        carbon fiber, steel, wood or plastic.
